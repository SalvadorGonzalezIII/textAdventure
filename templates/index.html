    <h2> Prologue </h2>
    <p>
              You are a tourist in search for your next adventure to go on. You've heard from villagers that there's an island not too far from the
              main land and decided that this is going to be your next stop. You head off at night even though there was a storm warning
              because you were so eager to get there. You head out and instantly start to feel the harsh currents and rain building up. Your
              boat got struck by lightning and goes down. You wake up hours later washed up on a shore of an uncharted island that couldn't be found on any map you've
              seen. Now that you're here, you have to try to survive and get back home!</p>
